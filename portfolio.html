      Conclusion Questions: 
      <br>
      1.) Why is it a good idea to write programs in small pieces and check how well they work after each piece is written?
      <br>
      <br>
      It is a good idea to work on programs in small pieces and check how they work, because it’s easier to find out if
      <br>
      there is a problem and fix it then rather than trying to find out what the problem is later.
      <br>
      <br>
      2.) Professional programmers usually have to write a piece of a program several times before they get it right. Think 
      <br>
      of other tasks in life that require you to figure things out. How is programming similar or different?
      <br>
      <br>
      In physics I have had to work on problems within the same chapter knowing which equation to plug the variables in;
      <br>
      sometimes I would use the wrong equation and have to plug it into a similar equation. Like programming I’ve had to
      <br>
      try and solve a problem from both completely starting over and changing little mistakes. 
      <br>
      <br>
      4.) The introduction to this activity said, “Even the most complicated software or cell phone app is made out of very
      <br>
      simple steps that happen one at a time.” That is not quite true. Each central processing unit core (CPU core) can
      <br>
      process one instruction at a time. A quad-core computer processes four instructions at once. But any computer can 
      <br>
      run more programs “at once” than the number of processor cores it has. How do you think a dual-core computer, for
      <br>
      instance, can make it look and feel like it is running ten or more programs at once?
      <br>
      <br>
      With a single processing core you can run a single process which contains multiple operations. With a dual processing
      <br>
      core you can run two processes, each process running multiple operations; Which can seem like it’s running 10+ programs 
      <br>
      at once.

      The Mario Super Bros program was written in MIT Scratch. The goal of the program is to reach Princess Peach's castle without falling. Once the program is started the user must use the left, right, and up arrows to move left, right, and jump through the levels. The user can walk and run into objects that they can use to their advantage. If the user falls they will have failed and have to restart. If the user makes it to Peach’s castle they will have completed the program and won.
