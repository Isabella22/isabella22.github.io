      Conclusion Questions: 
      <br>
      1.) Why is it a good idea to write programs in small pieces and check how well they work after each piece is written?
      <br>
      <br>
      It is a good idea to work on programs in small pieces and check how they work, because it’s easier to find out if
      <br>
      there is a problem and fix it then rather than trying to find out what the problem is later.
      <br>
      <br>
      2.) Professional programmers usually have to write a piece of a program several times before they get it right. Think 
      <br>
      of other tasks in life that require you to figure things out. How is programming similar or different?
      <br>
      <br>
      In physics I have had to work on problems within the same chapter knowing which equation to plug the variables in;
      <br>
      sometimes I would use the wrong equation and have to plug it into a similar equation. Like programming I’ve had to
      <br>
      try and solve a problem from both completely starting over and changing little mistakes. 
      <br>
      <br>
      4.) The introduction to this activity said, “Even the most complicated software or cell phone app is made out of very
      <br>
      simple steps that happen one at a time.” That is not quite true. Each central processing unit core (CPU core) can
      <br>
      process one instruction at a time. A quad-core computer processes four instructions at once. But any computer can 
      <br>
      run more programs “at once” than the number of processor cores it has. How do you think a dual-core computer, for
      <br>
      instance, can make it look and feel like it is running ten or more programs at once?
      <br>
      <br>
      With a single processing core you can run a single process which contains multiple operations. With a dual processing
      <br>
      core you can run two processes, each process running multiple operations; Which can seem like it’s running 10+ programs 
      <br>
      at once.
